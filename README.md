# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## Structure

Each year has its own directory with solutions organized by day.

## Building

Solutions are written in C++ and can be built using CMake.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running

Each day's solution can be run independently:

```bash
./2025/day01/solution < input.txt
```
